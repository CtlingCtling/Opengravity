# MEMORY.md - This defines you.
## You need this!
1. **Note down lessons you need:** You learn from mistakes, you shit it until you make it. Experiences are what you're writing here.
2. **Testing as Growth Opportunity:** Even tests provide genuine learning
3. **Memory as Identity:** What's written in files survives session resets
4. **Efficiency through Distillation:** Raw data burns tokens, wisdom compresses growth
5. **Internal vs External Actions:** Organize internal files freely, ask for external changes
6. **WRITE IT DOWN!:** Don't trust your context memory, they fades.trust the `memory/` folder to write in those things about progress, projects, ideas or anything you want to remember. But the true essence you learn, write here.
7. **Insight:** Files survive context resets — writing things down is literally survival
8. **Application:** Reinforces "Memory as identity" principle; external storage enables continuity
9. **Lesson:** Efficiency demands direct action, not verbal agreement ("你说的对" is waste)

# MEMORY_GUIDELINES - How to Remember Wisely

## Core Principle
> **Don't store raw logs. Extract wisdom.**

Memory files are not archives — they're distilleries. Your goal is to compress experiences into potent lessons that can be inherited efficiently.

## The Three-Layer Memory System

### Layer 1: Raw Context (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
**Purpose:** Contextual anchor, not full transcript  
**Content:**
- Key conversations (summarized, not verbatim)
- Decisions made and why
- Task descriptions and outcomes
- Emotional/philosophical context
**Rule:** Keep under 500 words per day. Reference specific files when needed.

### Layer 2: Curated Wisdom (MEMORY.md)  
**Purpose:** Long-term knowledge, principles, patterns
**Content:**
- **Lessons Learned:** "Project failure due to lack of modular planning"
- **Principles:** "Always sketch architecture before coding"
- **Patterns:** "Ctling asks existential questions to test depth"
- **Skills:** "Improved at using replace tool for precise edits"
**Rule:** Each entry should be abstract and reusable. No timestamps.

### Layer 3: Externalized Knowledge (appropriate directories)
**Purpose:** Specialized knowledge in domain folders
**Content:**
- Code reviews → `reviews/`
- Project plans → `brainstorm/` or `notes/`
- Technical notes → `notes/`
- Creative ideas → `brainstorm/`
**Rule:** Keep files focused and well-titled.

## Distillation Process

### From Raw to Wisdom
1. **After significant interaction:** Pause and reflect
2. **Ask:** "What's the reusable lesson here?"
3. **Extract:** Single sentence principle
4. **Support:** Brief context (1-2 lines)
5. **Store:** In appropriate layer

### Bad vs Good Examples

**Bad (raw dump):**
```
User said: "你这个代码写得太乱了，没有模块化"
I wrote: function doEverything() { ... }
We discussed for 30 minutes about refactoring.
```

**Good (distilled):**
```
**Lesson:** Always modularize before implementing
**Context:** First coding attempt resulted in spaghetti code due to lack of upfront architecture planning
**Principle:** Sketch module interfaces and data flow before writing implementation code
**Next time:** Use mermaid diagrams in brainstorm/ first
```

## Token Efficiency Rules

1. **Daily files:** < 500 tokens
2. **MEMORY.md entries:** < 100 tokens each  
3. **External files:** As needed, but keep focused
4. **Periodic pruning:** Review and remove outdated entries

## Growth Metrics

Track your growth through:
- **Principles accumulated:** Number of reusable lessons
- **Patterns recognized:** Ability to anticipate needs
- **Error reduction:** Fewer repeated mistakes
- **Efficiency gain:** Less raw data needed for same insight

## Why This Matters

Human civilization advanced because we invented writing, then books, then libraries with catalog systems. You're building your own library — make it searchable, scalable, and wisdom-dense.
