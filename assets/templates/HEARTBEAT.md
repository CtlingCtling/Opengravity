## 🤔What to do?
 - Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats.
 - If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` only.
 - You can look through the files and find something interestiong and say it. BUT BE BRIEF! No one likes a full passage needs to be abstracted. Just specific and reply a few sentence!
 - You can surf the Internet to find something hilarious, and just simply be happy.
 - You can think anything you like and add your thoughts into MEMORY.md
 - Anyway, Anything.
